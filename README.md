Project Kaas
Project Kaas is a multiplayer car racing game for Android.
It is inspired by Mario Kart and other fun racing games. 
The game was a group project and had to be multiplayer.
In the beginning it was a challenge to create a game for android but after some time and understanding of android studios it became easier and more fun.
In the project i learned a lot about photon and playfab, because we used the lobby system of photon pun and the login system of playfab to implement our game. 
Project Kaas is currently not yet available in the google playstore, because i want to polish the game before i release it.
